# Kings and Queens
## Introduction
This Ruby application provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for a user to navigate through and gain basic information on all historic queens and kings of England since 802 AD, when the Kingdom of Wessex was unified under King Egbert. For over a thousand years, the monarchy of England has been preserved and passed down; this CLI is a minor tribute to the rich royal history of the United Kingdom and, by extension, the world.

## Technical Aspects
The application predominantly uses the Nokogiri gem to extract information from the Britannica website and, from this level, digs one level deeper into the URL of each monarch to attain more information such as date of birth, death, reigning period, dynasty (with the notable exceptions of Oliver Cromwell and his son) and a short biography.
